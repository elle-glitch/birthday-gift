                        I just want to say that I will never forget our beautiful moments.
                        The way you used to call my name — ah, that moment.
                        The sound of your laughter when something was funny, I really loved it.
                        And the way you always fell asleep suddenly — I thought it was really cute.
                        I truly wanted to hug you when you fell asleep like that.
                        Those moments are treasures that I will carry forever.

                    <h3>What I Wish I Could Say 💔</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are moments when I wish everything had been different. I think about all my mistakes that disappointed you and wonder about all the “what ifs.” But all of that is just regret that comes when everything is already gone, and no matter how many times I apologize, it will never erase all the pain I caused you.

                        Even so, I will still apologize for all the pain you went through. I’m sorry that back then I couldn’t be a good man for you — someone who could give you a sense of security and make you feel loved. But I think now you have found someone who can give you everything I couldn’t, someone who makes you feel safe and is always there when you need him. And I’m happy if he can make you happy — unlike me, who only made you suffer and overthink all the time.

                        I hope you know that I never meant to hurt you or make you suffer under all that burden. I just wanted to be a good boyfriend to the person I loved, to make her feel loved and safe, but it seems I wasn’t able to be that person yet.

                        I’ve learned that maybe some people come into our lives not to stay, but to teach us what love, loss, and true letting go really mean. You taught me that, and I’m grateful — even though it hurts.

                        Do you remember when I told you that you were my first love? You couldn’t easily believe words like that, but you truly were the first person who made me feel love in my life. And I’m deeply grateful that it was you. Thank you for being the best part of my life, and I’m sorry for ever being the worst part of yours.

                        I will never regret meeting you, because it was the greatest happiness of my life to have once been someone you loved with all of yourself. I’m truly grateful for that. Being an important part of someone’s life makes me proud — especially when that person is you.

                        You know, I really miss the moments when we were together, like eating together, sleeping together, and doing all the little things we could do side by side. Thank you for accompanying me while I worked. I never thought there would be someone who would always stay with me during moments like that. I also never thought I would have someone I could call “home,” because whenever I was tired, that person was always there for me when I needed them. Thank you for that.

                        We went through happy times and unhappy times together, laughing and crying together — we went through all of it side by side. I truly loved those moments, but I couldn’t hold on to them. I’m sorry for ever being a bad man and not enough for you.

                        Even so, my love for you was always real and will always be there. If your new person says, “I love you,” he still doesn’t know that my love for you could go beyond anything.

                        Sometimes I cry like a little child when I remember the way you used to call my name — oh my God, that voice. And I don’t even know why I dream about you sending me messages. When I wake up and check my phone, I realize it was only a dream, and it makes me want to cry all over again.

                        I have truly lost someone incredibly precious in my life — someone who made every day feel more alive. Sometimes I really want to message you just to ask how you are, but I feel like I no longer deserve to do that after everything I did to you. Even though I always want to talk and share stories with you, I then realize that I’m no longer someone special to you, no longer someone you need.

                        Now, you don’t have to overthink as much as you used to — whether I exist in your life or not doesn’t matter anymore, because I mean nothing to you now. Even if I disappeared, no one would care.

                        Still, you will always be my favorite and most special person, because no one has ever been able to replace you since the day we met. Please never give up or feel sad, okay? I will always pray for the best for you from here on.

                        And I’m sorry if I say that I miss you so much and that I still love you deeply, but I will keep these feelings quietly to myself. Once again, I’m sorry for everything that has happened. I still want to say so much more, but I remember this is a gift, so I think I’ll stop here.
